            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2020, Captain Elliot's Flying School began as a small initiative to teach safe drone operation to local communities. Over the years, we’ve grown into a leading charity using drones for humanitarian aid, environmental conservation, and education. Our journey started with a vision to bridge technology and compassion, and today, we’re making a global impact.</p>

            <h3>Our Team</h3>
            <p>Our dedicated team includes experienced drone pilots, engineers, educators, and conservationists. Led by Captain Elliot, a pioneer in drone technology, our team combines expertise with passion to drive our mission forward. We collaborate with schools, NGOs, and governments to maximize our reach and impact.</p>

            <h3>Our Values</h3>
            <p>We are committed to innovation, sustainability, education, and community empowerment. Every project we undertake reflects our core values of integrity, transparency, and making a difference. We believe in the power of drones to solve real-world problems and inspire future generations.</p>
